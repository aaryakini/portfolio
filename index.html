                        <p class="noIndent">During my time in college, I (along with some friends) ran a coalition group called the 
                            Student Faculty Solidarity Alliance that organized students to support our part-time faculty union as 
                            they went on the longest adjunct faculty strike in US history in the process of negotiating a better 
                            contract with The New School.</p>
                        <p>At the time, I was also employed in various admin offices across the university. The momentum from this 
                            strike compelled us student workers to seek out unionization for ourselves, which resulted in the formation 
                            of the New Student Workers Union in early 2023.</p>
                        <p>While our union is still fighting for official reognition, a process that has not been without its several 
                            challenges, I wrote this op-ed when we officiated our Organizing Committee as a reflection of how legal 
                            precedent, public sentiment, and the organizing tools at students' disposal, all favor student employees, 
                            especially undergraduates, forming their own unions.</p>
