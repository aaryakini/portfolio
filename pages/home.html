                <p>This zine, whose full title is "home...and the complexities of 
                    cultural identity" is a personal reflection on the concept of 
                    home. For a myriad of reasons, most significantly, the 
                    distinction between where I grew up and the country on my 
                    passport, home for me has never been a physical place. 
                    Instead, my home is embodied in a wealth of cultural ephemera 
                    that remind me of the legacy from which I was borne. The texts 
                    in this document, which include notations of phonetic dance 
                    compositions, a recipe from my mother, and a speech, are all 
                    quintessential examples of oral traditions and histories, 
                    underscoring the idea of transience that I believe 
                    characterises my home. I hope that in some way, this personal 
                    reflection on what home is to me can provide you with a small 
                    glimpse into the beauty and richness of Indian culture.
