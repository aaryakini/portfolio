           Student workers at colleges and universities across America are forming unions to advocate for a living wage, safer working conditions and proper recourse for harassment. Here's why you and your co-workers should join them.

        Immigrating to the land of the free introduced me to many things —
        lightning bugs, snow, hotdogs, subway rats, but also the concept of
        workers’ rights. Coming from Singapore, a country with strict laws
        against industrial action, I didn’t even know what a union was until
        about two years ago. But when part-time faculty at my university
        went on strike last semester, the live-action orientation I received
        into the world of collective action was enough to convince me that
        every worker deserves a union — particularly student workers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, I am a dual-degree student at The New School majoring in
        Communication Design and Journalism. But I am also a student worker
        on campus, employed as a Student Assistant in the Dean’s Office at
        the renowned Parsons School of Design. I am amongst a group of
        almost 1500 other students at The New School who work in
        front-facing roles across the university. From being technicians at
        our specialized equipment labs, giving tours to parents and
        prospective students, acting as academic and residential advisors,
        and more, student workers are the ones that keep the university
        functioning on a daily basis.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a record-setting adjunct faculty strike at The New School
        during the Fall 2022 semester, where close to 1800 part-time
        faculty, unionized with the ACT-UAW Local 7902, went on a 25 day
        work stoppage to demand better working conditions, some of us
        student workers realized that we were facing a number of the same
        issues that our faculty were fighting to change. Watching the power
        of collective action manifest as the university finally gave in to a
        favorable contract, student workers came to the conclusion that we
        needed a union too. Thus was born the Organizing Committee of the
        New Student Workers Union (aka NewSWU, pronounced “noo-swoo”) — a
        wall-to-wall union of non-academic student workers at The New School
        — of which I am a proud representative.

        Fuelled by inflation, working conditions that seem to perpetually
        deteriorate, and a political and labor consciousness that has
        developed amongst younger generations coming out of the pandemic,
        union organizing has become an endeavor that, like NewSWU, a number
        of other graduate and even undergraduate student worker cohorts are
        taking on. In the last few months alone, student workers from
        various departments at Fordham, Rensselaer Polytechnic, Harvard,
        Boston University, University of Pennsylvania, and Wesleyan have all
        ratified their unions or publicly announced drives towards achieving
        one, and the trend only seems to be going upward.

      <p>
        But why should student workers unionize in the first place? As
        someone who has had to answer this question to university employers
        before, I would selfishly argue that the answer is simply because we
        can, since the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) guarantees that
        it is a worker’s democratic right in the United States to form a
        union and engage in collective bargaining, regardless of other
        conditions that may affect their employment. But in reality, there
        are a number of other compelling reasons as to why student workers
        should be unionized, with the following two being the most
        predominant answers in my conversations with co-organizers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Firstly, universities often use the verbiage of “student-worker” to
        their advantage to get away with providing sub-optimal working
        conditions and inadequate compensation for the labor of student
        workers. By insisting that a student worker’s primary occupation at
        the university is as a student and not a worker, they imply that in
        the hierarchy of needs that must be met, catering to a student
        worker’s academic pursuits takes precedence over ensuring that their
        financial and physiological needs are met through their
        university-controlled employment. In reality, these statuses are not
        mutually exclusive, and a university should be held accountable for
        providing both quality education as well as safe and equitable
        working conditions and compensation. A union for student workers can
        help mitigate this through a contract that establishes minimum wage
        and hours-per-week requirements, ensuring that student workers are
        able to pursue their education without the worry of working enough
        hours to sustain themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Secondly, student workers are often employed in front-facing roles
        across universities, such as student technicians, tour guides,
        receptionists and more, making them the first point-of-contact for
        most university services. This means that student workers are tasked
        with acting as good representatives for the ethos of a university,
        while also bearing the brunt of their community’s frustrations. I
        myself have had to deal with a fair share of rude emails from
        parents and students when working a desk job in the Orientation
        department at The New School. Unions can be beneficial in such
        situations as a union contract can stipulate adequate conflict
        resolution training for workers and ensure that they are afforded
        proper recourse in situations where they face harassment or feel
        unsafe in their workplaces. In fact, this is often a reason why a
        number of student worker union drives are centered around jobs that
        have a heavy front-facing component such as Resident Advisors or
        Dining Hall workers.

      <p>
        Now if you’re a student worker and all of this has convinced you
        that you need a union, your university, like most employers, may
        attempt to push the narrative that unions are unnecessary and can be
        detrimental to the relationship between them and their students
        since they foreground the employer-employee association instead. But
        this argument is rooted in, dare I say, an outdated way of thinking
        that stems from a time in which tertiary education was a lot less
        necessary and a lot more affordable. Both legal and historical
        precedent, as well as public sentiment show that student worker
        unions are a good thing, with the data to back it up.
      </p>

      <p>
        A key decision that set the stage for student workers to form unions
        came in 2016 when graduate student workers at Columbia University
        were unionizing. The university attempted to push back against their
        union drive using the argument that they were students first and
        thus not necessarily employees who were covered under the NLRA. But
        the National Labor Relations Board held that graduate assistants,
        and other student teaching and research assistants, were employees
        with a right to unionize, paving the way for a range of other
        graduate student worker unions to form including Student Employees
        at The New School (SENS-UAW Local 7902).
      </p>

      <p>
        Even though the NLRB’s decision doesn’t explicitly identify that
        undergraduate student workers are also covered by the NLRA the
        NLRB’s General Counsel, Jennifer Abruzzo, and Chairman, Lauran
        McFerran (both appointed to their positions by President Biden) have
        been unwavering in their support of labor organizing rights among
        student workers. Additionally, while Americans can’t seem to agree
        on a number of things, a study by Data for Progress shows that for
        the most part, voters are in support of student workers forming
        labor unions. Consequently, the Columbia decision, favor from the
        NLRB, and voter support make the current legal and social climate
        highly conducive to student unionization efforts.

      <p>
        During the strike
        last fall, student workers at The New School realized that our
        university was purposely designed to silo us and discourage us from
        being able to come together on the basis of mutual grievances. But
        the more we pushed beyond these artificial barriers and talked to
        each other, the more we realized that the problems we were facing of
        no overtime pay, a lack of control over our working hours, unsafe
        working conditions and more, were ubiquitous issues that we could
        overcome by working together. Not only does forming and ratifying a
        union allow you to advocate for each other, but there is power and
        protection in a collective. Unions are a true example of all for one
        and one for all.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you would like to begin unionizing your university workplace,
        know that your peers at other institutions will have your back. It
        is a type of resistance to exercise your legal rights to their
        fullest extent, and I encourage you to do so to advocate for
        yourself and your colleagues. At the end of the day, universities
        are businesses after all, and by using our agency we can refuse to
        let them take advantage of us under the guise that they are not.
